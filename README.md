Banking System

Project Overview
This Banking System is a Java-based project that simulates basic banking operations. It allows users to create accounts, log in, view their account balance, deposit and withdraw money, transfer funds between accounts, and view their transaction history. An administrator can log in to manage user accounts and view all transactions.

The system is built using Java for backend logic, MySQL for data storage, and a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing.
